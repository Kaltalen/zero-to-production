  in Angulars View Engine, it has is not been possible to lazy load entry
  components. This limitation could be worked around by using Web Components and
  Angular Elements. With the introduction of the Ivy Rendering Engine this is no
  longer needed (as entry components have been depreciated)
</p>
<p>
  Define a 'registry' of modules to be lazy loaded. The import path follows the
  same convention as when defining a route based lazy loaded module via the
  <em>loadChildren</em> route property. The Angular Compiler & Webpack will take
  care of code splitting for you. Then provide the registry as a provider to the
  parent module.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">{{ moduleProviders }}</code></pre>
<p>
  Create a <em>ModuleLoadingService</em> to handle loading the modules as
  required.
</p>
<p>
  NOTE: The code example of the module loading service below is simplified to
  emphasize the key points. Please see <a>TODO Module Loading Service</a> for
  full details
</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">{{ moduleLoadingService }}</code></pre>
<p>
  The lazy loading strategy (scrolling, dialog etc) will determine what to do
  once the module is loaded and compiled. For this example, The module loading
  service produces an Observable of the component factory so the scrolling
  component can subscribe and render the entry component once loaded.
