    Because we are lazy-loading components as we scroll here, if 'looks' odd if the
    first component is not rendered when you first navigate to this view.
    Because we don't lazy load the first component, we hard code the first component
    and bundle it in the main component.

    In this examples, our 'examples' state is hard coded and initialized in the entry component
    for the feature shell. Because of this we can guarantee the order of the examples.
    This might NOT be the case if you load data from a server and you will have to adapt appropriately
