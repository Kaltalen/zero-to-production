  A monorepo has many benefits, one if which is code sharing of libraries. The
  Todo Application below is it's own standalone application of which almost all
  of its code base is comprised of imported libraries that together makes up the
  application (Auth, Dashboard, Todos etc). As the application itself is just
  another library, it can be imported into other application.

  <h3>NOTE</h3>
  <p>
    The application below is a full, complete working application with a live
    API hosted on Google Cloud as provided in this monorepo. You will have to
    register before you can log in.
  </p>
  <p>
    For privacy reasons the API has been configured to accept dummy data (so not
    to collect and sensitive information). The email address provided does NOT
    have to be unique, so go ahead and put <b>test@email.com</b> or similar.
    Your username is the only thing required to be unique for registration to be
    successful.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Database will be wiped regularly so don't be surprised if you come back
    next week and its' all gone.
