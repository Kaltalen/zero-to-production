  A monorepo has many benefits, one if which is code sharing of libraries. The
  Todo Application below is it's own standalone application of which almost all
  of its code base is comprised of imported libraries that together makes up the
  application (Auth, Dashboard, Todos etc). As the application itself is just
  another library, it can be imported into any other application.
