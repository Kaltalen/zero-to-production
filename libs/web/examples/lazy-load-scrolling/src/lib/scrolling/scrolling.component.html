<p>
  Because of a long outstanding
  <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/14324"
    >bug/feature request</a
  >
  in View Engine, it has is not been possible to lazy load entry components.
  This limitation could be worked around by using Web Components and Angular
  Elements. With the introduction of the Ivy Rendering Engine this is no longer
  needed (as Entry Components have been depreciated)
</p>
<p>
  Define a 'registry' of modules to be lazy loaded. The import path follows the
  same convention as when defining `loadChildren` Just like when defining lazy
  loaded child routes. The Angular Compiler will take care of code splitting for
  you. Then provide the registry as a provider for the parent module.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">{{ moduleProviders }}</code></pre>
<p>
  Create a ModuleLoadingService to load the module when required.
</p>
<p>
  NOTE: The code example of the module loading service below is simplified to
  emphasize the key points. Please see <a>TODO Module Loading Service</a> for
  full details
</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">{{ moduleLoadingService }}</code></pre>
<p>
  The lazy loading strategy (scrolling, dialog etc) will determine what to do
  once the module is loaded and compiled. For this example, The module loading
  service produces an Observable of the component factory so the scrolling
  component can subscribe and render the entry component once loaded.
</p>
<p>
  NOTE: A LazyLoadScroll Directive is used to create the component from the
  factory. It makes use of the ResizeObserver API to listen element size
  changes. ResizeObserver is not currently widely supported and TypesScript does
  not have a definition for it, hence A polyfill is currently being used. See
  <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=Resize%20Observer">Can I Use</a> and
  <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/28502">TypeScript</a>

<h3>Try it Out</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Open Developer Tools -> Networking Tab</li>
  <li>Clear History</li>
  <li>Refresh Browser Window</li>
  <li>Slowly Start Scrolling</li>
  <li>Note the lazy loading of modules as you scroll</li>
  <li>Profit!!</li>
</ol>
